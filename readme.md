# Beeverse

Beeverse is a survival city builder to grow and sustain a bee colony.  The main objective is to keep your bees alive by collecting resources and expanding the colony.  The game starts with a single honeycomb inhabited by your Queen Bee which you must expand from by building new Honeycomb structures.  Honeycombs increase your bee population capacity and allow your Worker Bees to perform new tasks such as the construction of new Honeycomb types, resource conversion, and raising new Baby Bees.  Bees have a lifespan and will passively die over time.  The game will end if your Queen Bee dies without a replacement or your colony dies out from old age, so keep on building!
